                        <p>The 2021 Summer Olympics came and went and Canada came away with quite a haul.</p>
                        <p>Canada brought home 24 total medals this year, a new high for a non-boycotted Summer Games. The bronze by Laurence Vincent Lapointe and Katie Vincent in women's C2 500-meter canoe sprint broke a tie with the hauls from Rio and Athens at 22. The gold on the final day of competition by Kelsey Mitchell in women's cycling sprint established the new mark.Swimmer Penny Oleksiak became Canada's most decorated athlete — summer or winter, man or woman — by adding three medals for a total of seven. Andre De Grasse went 3 for 3 again, this time snagging gold in the 200 meters, and is now Canada's most decorated male Olympian. Damian Warner topped the lofty 9,000-point mark in the decathlon to win gold and was named flagbearer for the closing ceremony.</p>
